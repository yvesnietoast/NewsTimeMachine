Japanese Prime Minister Fugio Kishida addresses joint session of Congress	
In 2020, the Russian dissident and author, Alexei Navalny, started writing his memoir, which will be released in October. 
The publisher has described it as Navalny's final letter to the world. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited Capitol Hill to 
address a joint meeting of Congress. During his speech, he expressed Japan's support for the US and its allies, while also sharing a personal connection 
to the US. Kishida revealed that he spent the first three years of elementary school in Queens, New York, and his family lived like Americans during that 
time, taking the subway to Manhattan where his father worked as a trade officer. 
He also shared how they rooted for the Mets and Yankees and ate hot dogs at Coney Island. Kishida's speech received laughter and applause from lawmakers.



"Toxic": Marjorie Taylor Greene not backing down from trying to oust Speaker Johnson
Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican Congresswoman from Georgia, is not backing down from her attempt to oust House Speaker
 Mike Johnson despite criticism from some of her colleagues. In an interview with CNN, Greene stated that she believes there are enough Democrats who
  would support her effort to remove Johnson if he were to allow a vote on a bill related to Ukraine without a quorum.

Greene's comments sparked a heated debate, with some lawmakers questioning her motives and others expressing concern about the potential fall
out of such an action. However, Greene maintained that she is simply standing up for what she believes in and defending innocent women and children
 who are being affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

The situation has raised questions about the dynamics of the House of Representatives, with some lawmakers suggesting that Greene's actions could
 lead to a more toxic political environment. Others have expressed concern that Greene's efforts could harm the country's ability to address important
  issues and make history-changing decisions.

The debate highlights the challenges of navigating the complexities of partisan politics while also trying to effect change on important issues. 
It remains to be seen how Greene's effort to remove Johnson will play out, but it is clear that the situation has the potential to significantly
 impact the political landscape in Washington.

Oklahoma lawmakers consider bill to criminalize intentional, reckless spread of STIs	
NOW WITH THE LATEST ON THIS. ZACK, I KNOW YOU SPOKE WITH BOTH
SIDES TODAY. EVAN. ABBY. THAT’S RIGHT. THE FEAR HERE IS THAT IF
SPREADING A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED
INFECTION IS CRIMINALIZED, THAT
IT MIGHT CAUSE SOME PEOPLE TO BE
AFRAID TO GO AND GET TESTED. THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL SAYS THAT
THIS IS NOT MEANT TO GO AFTER
INNOCENT PEOPLE. IF YOU WERE KNOWINGLY AND
WILLINGLY INFECTING PEOPLE WITH
THIS DISEASE, STATE
REPRESENTATIVE TONY HASSELBACH
AUTHORED HOUSE BILL 3098. IT WOULD MAKE ANYONE WHO
INTENTIONALLY OR RECKLESSLY
SPREADS A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED
INFECTION INTO A FELON,
PUNISHABLE BY UP TO 2 TO 5 YEARS
IN PRISON. THIS IS A PERSON THAT KNOWS THEY
HAVE A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE AND
THEY ARE CHOOSING WILLFULLY AND
INTENTIONALLY TO GIVE IT TO
ANOTHER HUMAN. THERE’S ALREADY A LAW ON THE
BOOKS THAT DOES THIS FOR
SMALLPOX, SYPHILIS, AND
GONORRHEA. HASSELBECK’S BILL WOULD ADD
CHLAMYDIA, HEPATITIS B, GENITAL
HERPES, HPV, AND TRICHOMONIASIS
TO THE LIST. WE’VE HAD SOME DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
CASES AND SOME SEXUAL ABUSE
CASES COME UP IN THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA. BUT SOME HEALTH ADVOCATES SAY
THIS BILL COULD ACTUALLY DO MORE
HARM THAN GOOD. RECKLESS IS NOT DEFINED IN THE
BILL, WHICH LEAVES AN OPEN DOOR
FOR UNNECESSARY LAWSUITS,
LAWSUITS AND PROSECUTIONS. REPORTER JEFF BERG, WITH HOPE
TESTING A HEALTH SERVICE CENTER,
SAYS CRIMINALIZING STIS COULD
MAKE PEOPLE AFRAID TO GO GET
TESTED OUT OF FEAR THAT THEY
WILL BE CHARGED CRIMINALLY IF THEY SPREAD IT. WE AGREE OKLAHOMA HAS AN STI
PROBLEM, BUT THE ANSWER IS
EDUCATION AND TREATMENT, NOT
CRIMINALIZATION. HE POINTS TO DATA FROM THE
OKLAHOMA STATE HEALTH
DEPARTMENT, WHICH SAYS 85% OF
OKLAHOMANS WILL GET AN HPV
INFECTION IN THEIR LIFETIME. HPV TESTS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR
WOMEN, WHICH MEANS THE MAJORITY
OF MEN WILL NEVER KNOW IF THEY
HAVE IT. THE CDC ALSO SAYS OKLAHOMA RANKS
11TH FOR CHLAMYDIA, FIFTH FOR
GONORRHEA, AND FOURTH FOR
SYPHILIS CASES. MANY OKLAHOMANS ARE UNAWARE OF
WHAT STIS ARE OR HOW TO PREVENT
THEM, AND WHAT RESOURCES ARE
AVAILABLE. PRISONS SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF
THEM, HASSELBECK SAYS SHE
BELIEVES HER BILL WOULD ACTUALLY
ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO GET
TESTED IF YOU COULD BE PUNISHED
FOR DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS, I THINK IT WOULD BE INCENTIVIZE TO
BE TESTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
COULDN’T GO TO JAIL FOR DOING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. NOW, THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY
AWAITING A VOTE IN THE SENATE. IT PASSED OUT OF T
